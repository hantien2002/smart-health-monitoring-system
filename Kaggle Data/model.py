# Based on the nature of the data, decide on appropriate machine learning models. 
# For health data, models that excel in time series analysis or classification might be suitable.

# After training, evaluate the model's performance using suitable metrics. 
# Depending on the results, we might need to iterate on the model by tweaking it or using different algorithms.
