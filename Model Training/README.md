# Model Training Directory

## Overview
This directory contains all the necessary components for the model training phase of our Smart Health Monitoring System. It's set up to simulate real-world data processing using datasets sourced from Kaggle.

## Contents
- **Kaggle Data**: Includes datasets from Kaggle that simulate health-related metrics from wearable IoT devices. These datasets provide insights into heart rate, sleep patterns, and activity levels, serving as a foundation for our model training.
- **Python Scripts**: Contains Python files used for creating and training machine learning models. These scripts handle data preprocessing, model development, training, and evaluation.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this folder is to facilitate the development and fine-tuning of machine learning models using simulated data. The models trained here will be integral to providing accurate and real-time health insights in our final application.

## Usage
To use these scripts, ensure you have the necessary Python environment and dependencies set up. The datasets from Kaggle must be placed in the designated data folder before running the scripts.
